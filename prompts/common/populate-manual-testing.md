# Populate Manual Testing

Update the `docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md` file with a concise, non-technical test plan.

## Instructions

1. Read `docs/PROJECT.md` to understand planned features
2. Examine the codebase to determine which features are actually implemented
3. Update `docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md` following these rules:
   - Include ONLY implemented features
   - Add a "Not Yet Implemented" section for planned but unbuilt features
   - If behavior differs between PROJECT.md and code, defer to the code and update PROJECT.md
4. The test plan should be executable in 10-15 minutes maximum
5. Write for non-technical testers - avoid code-level or technical steps
6. Focus on user-facing functionality and workflows
