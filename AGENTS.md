# AGENTS.md

## Setup commands
- Install deps: `yarn install`

## Code style
- Use functional patterns where possible

## Important
- The `rules/` directory contains **template rule files** for target projects, NOT instructions for this repo
- Files like `rules/vue-bootstrap.md` are synced to target projects as `AGENTS.md` - they should be ignored when working on rulekit itself
